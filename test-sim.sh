# booted Simulator so you can see it run without needing a device,
# provisioning profile, or signing team (Simulator apps don't need real
# code signing).
#
# Usage: ./test-sim.sh [--no-build] ["iPhone 16"]
#   --no-build       Skip configure+build, just reinstall/relaunch whatever
#                     was built last (e.g. after only editing a WAD/asset,
#                     or to relaunch after it crashed).
#   Optional arg:     simulator device name (default: whatever's already
#                     booted, or "iPhone 16" if nothing is booted).
